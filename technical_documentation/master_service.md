# Master Service
The Master Service in the only contact point with the Frontend, besides the User Service for authentication. Its main responsibility is to compute a given routine, validate the outcome and send it back to the Frontend.
Since this is only a high-level described goal, it is reasonable to have a look at all the exposed endpoints of the Master Service in order to gain a holistic overview of the capabilities of the Master Service:
`/api/routine/
/api/functions
/api/apis/
/api/available_components`
