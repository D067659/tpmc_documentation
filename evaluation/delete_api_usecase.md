### Evaluation
#### Task

Delete an existing API based on the following information:

In the list, select the API `Typo - Delete me`, click on "Show Detail" and switch to edit mode.
Notice, that some misspelled words appear in non-changeable fields.
Delete the API by clicking on "Delete API" and confirm the warning pop-up.

Now, this API should not be listed in the Developer Suite anymore. Feel free to try it out!

#### Control criteria
A deleted API is removed from the users account. Thus, it should be not discoverable anymore when searching the available API list in "Manage APIs".
