# Use Case based Evaluation
## Introduction
In this section we will give some use cases our platform covers. The use cases cover the actors in the use case, the success scenario. Additionally we specify an evaluation task a test user can fulfill to test the performance of our plattform.

## Evaluation
One part of our evaluation will be based on how well users can fulfill the use cases. Therefore each use case will consist of a Task that can be done by a test user for evaulation. Each task has evaluation and control criteria.

## Terms
### Standard user
The standard user requires less technical knowledge. Its primary aim is to create its own routines.
### Advanced user
The advanced user has more technical knowledge. Besides creating routines the advanced user will also add new functions and APIs.

## Use Cases
1. [Create Routine](create_routine_usecase.md)
2. [Create Function](create_function_usecase.md)
3. [Edit Function](edit_function_usecase.md)
4. [Delete Function](delete_function_usecase.md)
5. [Create API](create_api_usecase.md)
6. [Edit API](edit_api_usecase.md)
7. [Delete API](delete_api_usecase.md)
