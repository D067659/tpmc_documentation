Please provide information about your required time, occurred problems and comments on the evaluation tasks to us. This is done via a formless Discord message.

The app is launched at https://tpmc.gsq.ro/. 
We refrained from creating an account for you, in order to maximize the "MTP Platform" experience.
Please create one by yourself, but do not forget to add the basic bundle (containing lots of functions and APIs) to your creation process.

For this reason, please use the following activation key on prompt: [ACTIVATION KEY].

For task 5 (Create API) you are asked to provide header data for the API. Please specify the two key-value pairs [KEY]:[VALUE] and [KEY]:[VALUE] as the header data.


If you are facing any technical issues or are unable to solve a task, even with the provided hints, do not hesitate to contac tus via the Discord channel at any time.
